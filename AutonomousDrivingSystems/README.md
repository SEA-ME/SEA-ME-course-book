# **Autonomous Driving Systems**

The term autonomous driving systems refers to advanced technology that allows vehicles to drive themselves without human intervention. These systems are designed to provide a high degree of safety, comfort, and efficiency, and to make driving more convenient and accessible for people. 

Autonomous driving systems typically consist of a combination of hardware and software components. The hardware components include sensors, such as cameras, radar, and lidar, that are used to gather information about the vehicle's surroundings. This information is processed by the system's control unit, which includes a central computer and various microcontrollers. The software components of the system include algorithms that use the information gathered by the sensors to make decisions about the vehicle's movements and behavior.

Autonomous driving systems use various technologies and techniques to enable vehicles to drive themselves, including machine learning, computer vision, and control systems. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by the sensors and to make predictions about the behavior of other road users and the environment. Computer vision algorithms are used to interpret the images captured by cameras and to detect objects and features in the environment. Control systems algorithms are used to control the vehicle's movements, including steering, acceleration, and braking, based on the information gathered by the sensors and the predictions made by the machine learning algorithms.

The development of autonomous driving systems requires a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together expertise from fields such as computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and more. The development process involves a combination of simulation, testing, and real-world deployment, as well as close collaboration between software engineers, hardware engineers, and designers.

Overall, autonomous driving systems have the potential to transform the mobility industry, providing safer, more convenient, and more accessible driving experiences for people. However, the development of these systems is complex and challenging, requiring close collaboration between various disciplines and a deep understanding of the technologies and techniques involved.

Learning autonomous driving systems through peer-peer educational projects can provide students with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of the current and future industry requirements. In this type of educational approach, students work together in small teams to design and develop projects related to autonomous driving systems. These projects are designed to be closely aligned with current and future industry requirements, ensuring that students gain the skills and knowledge that are most relevant and in-demand.

Here are a few steps that could be involved in learning autonomous driving systems through peer-peer educational projects:

1. **Familiarization with key technologies**: Students start by gaining an understanding of the key technologies and concepts involved in autonomous driving systems, such as computer vision, machine learning, and control systems. Students also familiarize themselves with opportunities, limits, and ethical / governance questions around the use of autonomous vehicles. 

2. **Team formation and project selection**: Students then form teams and select a project that they want to work on. The project should be relevant to autonomous driving systems and aligned with current and future industry requirements.

3. **Project planning and development**: Teams then plan and develop their projects, working together to integrate the various components of the autonomous driving system, such as sensors, control units, and software algorithms.

4. **Testing and validation**: Teams then test and validate their projects, both in simulation and in real-world environments, to ensure that the system meets the desired requirements.

5. **Presentation and reflection**: Teams then present their projects to their peers and instructors, reflecting on what they learned and what could be improved.

Peer-to-peer educational projects provide students with the opportunity to work on real-world projects, develop their technical and team-working skills, and gain hands-on experience in developing autonomous driving systems. This approach also provides students with an understanding of the current and future industry requirements and helps to prepare them for careers in the mobility industry.
