# **Distributed Embedded Systems**

Distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry are complex systems that combine hardware, software, and networking components to create advanced and highly integrated systems for vehicles. These systems typically include a wide range of components, including microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and communication networks.

One of the key features of distributed embedded systems is their use of multiple microcontrollers, each of which is responsible for a specific function or task. For example, one microcontroller may be responsible for controlling the engine, while another may be responsible for controlling the infotainment system. These microcontrollers are connected through a communication network, such as Controller Area Network (CAN) or Local Interconnect Network (LIN), which enables them to exchange data and collaborate to achieve the desired behavior of the vehicle.

Another important aspect of distributed embedded systems is the use of software. This includes both low-level software, such as drivers and firmware, and high-level software, such as user interfaces and applications. The software used in these systems must be highly reliable and performant, as it is responsible for critical functions such as safety and performance.

The use of networking technologies, such as Ethernet and VSOMEIP/CommonAPI, is also critical for distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry. These technologies enable vehicles to connect to other vehicles, to infrastructure, and to the internet, creating a highly connected and intelligent mobility ecosystem.

The development of distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry requires a deep understanding of a wide range of technologies, including hardware, software, and networking. Additionally, it requires close collaboration between hardware and software engineers, as well as designers and testers, to ensure that the systems are reliable, performant, and meet the complex requirements of the industry and users.

Overall, distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry are critical components of the modern vehicle, and play a key role in enabling the development of advanced and highly integrated systems for vehicles. Whether it is for safety, performance, connectivity, or entertainment, these systems are essential for delivering a high-quality and innovative driving experience.

Learning distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry through peer-to-peer educational projects is a great way to gain hands-on experience and to develop practical skills that are highly relevant to current and future industry requirements. The following steps can be taken to get started:

1. **Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals**: Start by learning the basics of distributed systems, embedded systems, and the automotive industry. This may include topics such as automotive communication protocols (e.g. CAN, LIN, Ethernet), embedded software development (e.g. RTOS, programming languages, debug techniques), and automotive industry trends and requirements (e.g. autonomous vehicles, connectivity, electrification).

2. **Form a group**: Find other students with similar interests and form a group to work on educational projects together. Having a group can provide a supportive environment, facilitate collaboration, and provide opportunities to learn from one another.

3. **Identify project ideas**: Choose a project idea that aligns with your interests and skills, and that is relevant to the current or future requirements of the automotive industry. Some possible project ideas include developing a digital twin of a vehicle, building an autonomous vehicle control system, or designing a networked system for electric vehicle charging.

4. **Divide tasks**: Divide the project into smaller tasks that can be worked on by individual team members. This will make it easier to manage the project, keep track of progress, and ensure that everyone has a clear role to play.

5. **Start coding**: Start coding and implementing the project using the tools, technologies, and platforms that are relevant to the automotive industry (e.g. Qt, Wayland, VSOMEIP/CommonAPI, etc.).

6. **Test and refine:** Regularly test the project and refine it based on the results. This will help to identify and resolve issues, improve performance, and ensure that the project meets industry requirements.

7. **Present and share**: Once the project is complete, present it to others and share your experience and learning. This will provide an opportunity to showcase your work, receive feedback, and connect with others in the industry.

By following these steps, students can develop a deeper understanding of distributed embedded systems in the mobility industry and to gain practical skills that are in high demand in the job market. Additionally, working on peer-peer educational projects can help to foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for collaboration and networking.
